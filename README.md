# 👋 Greetings, Cyber Guardians!

I’m **VETTRIVEL U**, a passionate **Offensive Security Expert** hailing from **Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, India 🇮🇳**.

I'm specialized in **Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT), Red Teaming, and Offensive Security Operations** — with a proven track record of breaching systems to secure them.

I’ve earned multiple **Hall of Fame recognitions from MNCs** for responsibly disclosing critical vulnerabilities. From gaining root access to high-level systems to pwning servers, I’ve had the thrill of ethically exploiting and helping secure both **Indian and US government infrastructures**.

Along the way, I’ve bagged exclusive **swags and rewards**, and I’m proudly listed as a **Top Voice in Information Security on LinkedIn**.

As a **freelancer**, I collaborate with companies to work on outsourced security projects — and have been **paid by top-tier organizations** for my findings.

I also love giving back to the community: conducting **classes, webinars, and mentorship sessions** for juniors and aspiring bug bounty hunters.

I recently **qualified for the finals of a national-level Hackathon x CTF**, proving my ability to think under pressure and hack smart.

You’ll often find me **sharing deep dives and writeups on Medium**, covering everything from **0-day findings to beginner tips**.
